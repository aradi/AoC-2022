Advent of Code 2022
===================

My solutions for `Advent of Code 2022 <https://adventofcode.com/2022>`_, mostly
in Fortran and Python.

Note: The solutions uploaded here are meant to demonstrate possible
implementations of the required algorithms. They are quite clean, but they
are not modularized, as they should in a production code.
